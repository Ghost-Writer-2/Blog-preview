## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned more on html accessibility and I practiced using CSS relative units. 

```html
<!-- Add main and footer elements -->
 <main>...</main>
 <footer>...</footer>
```
```css

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 20px;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  max-width: 23rem;
  height: auto;
  margin-top: 7vh;
}
```


### Continued development
 
I want to improve my ability to create Responsive layouts and use Javascript to add responsiveness to web page

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - This helped me in searching for solutions and tips. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
